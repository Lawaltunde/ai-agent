# AI Agent

This project is a simple AI agent that uses the Google Gemini model to generate text based on a prompt. It's built with TypeScript and runs on the Bun runtime.

## ‚ú® Features

*   Generates text using the latest Gemini AI model.
*   Uses the Vercel AI SDK for seamless integration.
*   Fast and efficient, thanks to Bun.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
*   A Google AI API key.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lawaltunde/ai-agent.git
    cd ai-agent
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google AI API key:

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

### Usage

To run the agent, execute the following command:
